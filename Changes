Revision history for Perl extension Facebook::OpenGraph

## CAUTION ####################################################################

FROM Version 1.22 it doesn't check if 'expires' parameter is properly returned
from /oauth/access_token endpoint. Affected methods are listed below:

- get_user_token_by_code
- get_user_token_by_cookie
- exchange_token

There are some edge cases that they do not return 'expires' so this module does
not check its existense, any more. If 'expires' should be returned on your use
case, you must explicitly check by yourself.
The detailed schenario concerning those edge cases are shown at the link below.
